# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
Return `k`.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 2 - Optimization Solution 1
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

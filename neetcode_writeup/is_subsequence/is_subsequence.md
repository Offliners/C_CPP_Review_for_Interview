# Is Subsequence
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(N*M)$
* Space complexity: $O(N)$

### Solution 2 - Dynamic Programming
* Time complexity: $O(N)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 3 - Two Pointers
* Time complexity: $O(max(N, M))$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

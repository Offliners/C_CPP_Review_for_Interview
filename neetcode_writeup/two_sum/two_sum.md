# Two Sum
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 2 - Hash Table
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(n)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

## Result

# Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(n)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

## Result
Test on testcases generated by myself

# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Solution 1 - Linear Search
* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 2 - Binary Search
* Time complexity: $O(log n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build

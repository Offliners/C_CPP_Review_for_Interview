# Single Number
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Solution 1 - XOR
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

## Result
Test on testcases generated by myself

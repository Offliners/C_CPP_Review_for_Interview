# Climbing Stairs
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Solution 1 - Fibonacci sequence (Recursion)
* Time complexity: $O(2^n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 2 - Dynamic Programming
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(n)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

## Result
Test on testcases generated by myself

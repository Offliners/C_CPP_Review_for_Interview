# Search a 2D Matrix II
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:
* Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
* Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(M * N)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 2 - Optimization Solution One
* Time complexity: $O(M + N)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

## Result

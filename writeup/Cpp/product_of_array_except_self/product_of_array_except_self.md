# Product of Array Except Self
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: $O(n)$

### Solution 2 - Dynamic Programming (One Table)
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(2n)$

### Solution 3 - Dynamic Programming (Two Table)
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(3n)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build

# Diameter of Binary Tree
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

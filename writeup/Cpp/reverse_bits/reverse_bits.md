# Reverse Bits
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note:
* Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

### Solution 1 - Bit Manipulation
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Usage
```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ..
$ python3 compare.py
```

## Result
Test on testcases generated by myself

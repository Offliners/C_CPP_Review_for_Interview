# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Solution 1 - Brute Force
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

### Solution 2 - Binary Search
* Time complexity: $O(log n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

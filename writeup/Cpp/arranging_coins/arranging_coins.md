# Arranging Coins
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `ith` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

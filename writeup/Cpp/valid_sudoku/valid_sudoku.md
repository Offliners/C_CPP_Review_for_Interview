# Valid Sudoku
Detail : [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Note:
* A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
* Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
